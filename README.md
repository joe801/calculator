## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt some functions and codes I've never used or had to used before like;

```html
<div onclick="document.calc.txt.value +='.'">.</div>
```
```css
#btn2:checked:after, #btn1:checked:after, #btn3:checked:after {
    width: 14px;
    height: 14px;
    border-radius: 15px; 
    position: relative;
    background-color: var(--equal-background);
    content: '';
    display: inline-block;
    visibility: visible;
    opacity: 0.9;
}
```
```js
document.body.classList.add("theme2");
 document.body.classList.remove("body");
```

### Continued development

I want to work on making my codes shorter.

### Useful resources

I learnt the new stuff I know working on this project from Gooogle. AS the saying goes; "as a developer, Google is your best friend" ðŸ˜‰.
